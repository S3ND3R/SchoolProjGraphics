## Assessment for Assignment 01

#### Total score: _96_ / _100_

Run on February 11, 19:02:53 PM.

+ :heavy_check_mark:  Checking out A1 submission.




#### Necessary Files and Structure

+ :heavy_check_mark:  Check that directory "dev" exists.

+ :heavy_check_mark:  Check that directory "dev/a1_textrain" exists.

+ :heavy_check_mark:  Check that directory "dev/a1_textrain/data" exists.

+ :heavy_check_mark:  Check that file "dev/a1_textrain/a1_textrain.pde" exists.


#### General Requirements

+ :heavy_check_mark:  Running Processing sketch...



+ :heavy_check_mark:  Inspecting Processing sketch...



+ :heavy_check_mark:  _50_ / _50_ :  Processing sketch compiles and runs

    


#### Work in the "C" Range

+ :heavy_check_mark:  _15_ / _15_ :  Draw video frames

    

+ :heavy_check_mark:  _2_ / _2_ :  Load font into Processing

    

+ :heavy_check_mark:  _6_ / _6_ :  Draw characters on top of video

    

+ :heavy_check_mark:  _6_ / _6_ :  Animate falling characters

    


#### Work in the "B" Range

+ :heavy_check_mark:  _3_ / _3_ :  Make characters stop falling when they "land" on a dark object

    

+ :heavy_check_mark:  _1_ / _1_ :  Interactive thresholding (UP / DOWN keys)

    

+ :heavy_check_mark:  _1_ / _1_ :  Threshold debugging (SPACEBAR toggle)

    

+ :heavy_check_mark:  _1_ / _1_ :  Video in grayscale, text in color

    

+ :heavy_check_mark:  _2_ / _2_ :  Flip video image

    

+ :heavy_check_mark:  _2_ / _2_ :  Pick characters from a text

    


#### Work in the "A" Range

+ :heavy_check_mark:  _2_ / _2_ :  Rain doesn't pass through thin lines

    

+ :heavy_check_mark:  _3_ / _3_ :  Rain rises up with viewer's hand

    

+ :heavy_check_mark:  _0_ / _2_ :  Wall clock based rain velocity

    Velocity is frame-locked. millis() is called, but not used in calculating change in position. (-2)

+ :heavy_check_mark:  _0_ / _2_ :  Smarter character-picking algorithm

    Letters are shuffled, but they do not seem to be shuffled in a way that would ensure that whole words would sometimes be formed. (-2)

+ :heavy_check_mark:  _2_ / _2_ :  Velocity variation on raindrops

    


#### Additional Notes

+ :heavy_check_mark:  Comments:

    Letters change colors when they come into contact with a dark object. Nice!

#### Total score: _96_ / _100_
