## Assessment for Assignment 03 (Graded by: Nikki Kyllonen)

#### Total score: _99_ / _100_

#### Necessary Files and Structure (_50_ / _50_)

+ :heavy_check_mark: Path exists: dev/a3-earthquake





#### Rubric (_49_ / _50_)

#### Work in the "C" Range:

+ :heavy_check_mark: _20.0_ / _20_ : Rectangle mesh is initially rendered to the screen. (Regardless of texturing.)

+ :heavy_check_mark: _6.0_ / _6_ : 'Toggle Debug Mode' shows edges of each triangle in the mesh and the mesh is subdivided into slices and stacks.

+ :heavy_check_mark: _3.0_ / _3_ : QuakeApp uses a helper function for calculating flat positions from latitude and longitude values.



#### Work in the "B" Range:

+ :heavy_check_mark: _3.0_ / _3_ : Earth is rendered as a textured rectangle.

+ :heavy_check_mark: _4.0_ / _4_ : Earthquakes are visualized at the correct locations on the rectangle.

+ :heavy_check_mark: _3.0_ / _3_ : Earthquake visualizations use sizes and colors in meaningful ways.




#### Work in the "C" Range:

+ :x: _2.0_ / _3_ : Earth and QuakeApp classes use a helper function for calculating sphere positions from latitude and longitude values.
   >Earth class does not use spherical coordinates helper function. (-1)

+ :heavy_check_mark: _2.0_ / _2_ : Sphere mesh is rendered to screen. (Regardless of texturing.)

+ :heavy_check_mark: _2.0_ / _2_ : Earth is rendered as a textured sphere. (Abrupt transition allowed.)

+ :heavy_check_mark: _2.0_ / _2_ : Earthquakes are visualized at the correct locations on the sphere.

+ :heavy_check_mark: _2.0_ / _2_ : Mesh smoothly transforms between the flat map and the globe using member variables of the Earth class which contain flat vertices and spherical vertices.



#### Additional Comments:

+ _0.0_ / _0_ : Comments:
   >Great job with the dragging! Please remove print statements that happen frequently (such as every frame) since these are slow and expensive. They also seem to freeze up the grading scripts. Overall great job. More work was needed on the README.
