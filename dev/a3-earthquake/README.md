## Description
- magnitude was used for the size and color of the spheres.
  - magnitude was normalized and then a scalar of .10 was used to give the
    sphere an appropriate radius size.

  - The color of the sphere had the red color value reflect the normalized magnitude.
  I used the formula for scaling that was provided in the handout to scale the brightness
  up to a range that was visually appealing while still clearly showing the variation in
  magnitude.
